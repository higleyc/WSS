I have set up a personal repository for my work on Github: https://github.com/higleyc/WSS. The Professor Plotka and the TA have been added as collaborators.

Our team repository is hosted at: https://github.com/michael-han/FunDo.
Our code is hosted on myrpi.org at fundo.myrpi.org.
We are using Github Issues for our issue tracker.
